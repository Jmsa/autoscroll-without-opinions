# autoscroll-without-opinions
The AutoScroll module you didn't know you needed until you did.

# VIP NOTE
This lib is still experimental so please only download at your own risk -- I will tag the release as stable when the interface is unlikely to change further.

# Docs
Stay tuned for docs you did know you needed but didn't have because I haven't written them yet.

# Tests
Tests or perish <no but I also need to check these in>
